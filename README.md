# Refugee Shelter Application Backend

This repository contains the backend API for the Refugee Shelter application, a volunteer-driven project aimed at improving the process of managing bed and room assignments in a shelter for Ukrainian refugees.

## Overview

The backend is a Node.js application that provides the necessary APIs for managing room and bed allocations in real-time, tracking the number of people in the shelter, and recording the total number of individuals who have passed through since the shelterâ€™s opening. It enables both HTTP and WebSocket communications to facilitate seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, allowing multiple volunteers to update and view shelter status in real-time.

This system helps volunteers to easily manage space allocation, as well as plan meals by providing an accurate count of people staying at the shelter at any given time.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: For building the API.
- **Socket.IO**: For enabling real-time communication with the frontend.
- **MongoDB**: For storing shelter data.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation.
- **Deployment**: The backend is deployed on Render.

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is built with React and communicates with this backend through HTTP requests and WebSocket connections. The frontend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jackavryashnik/hope-shelter-room-check).

## API Documentation

The Swagger documentation for the API can be accessed at `/api-docs` after running the backend. This provides detailed information on all available endpoints and their usage.
